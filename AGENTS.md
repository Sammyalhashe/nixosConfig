# Agent Commands and Derivation Management

This document outlines the commands that the agent is permitted to execute within this flake, and demonstrates how to build and test derivations.

## Building/Testing Derivations

You can build and test derivations within this flake using the `nix build` and `nix test` commands.

### Example: Building a theme configuration (from dynamic theme switching task)

To build the dark theme configuration generated by the flake:
```bash
nix build .#packages.x86_64-linux.darkThemeConfigs
```

### Example: Showing flake outputs

To list all available outputs from the flake:
```bash
nix flake show
```

## Allowed Commands (Shell)

The agent has been permitted to execute the following shell commands:

*   `mkdir`: Used for creating directories.
    *   Example: `mkdir my-new-directory`
*   `ls`: Used for listing directory contents.
    *   Example: `ls -F some-directory/`
*   `rm`: Used for removing files or directories.
    *   Example: `rm -rf my-old-directory`
*   `chmod`: Used for changing file permissions.
    *   Example: `chmod +x my-script.sh`
*   `git restore`: Used for discarding changes in the working directory.
    *   Example: `git restore some-file.nix`
*   `git clone`: Used for cloning Git repositories.
    *   Example: `git clone https://github.com/some/repo some-repo-dir`
*   `nix build`: Used for building Nix derivations.
    *   Example: `nix build .#some-package`
*   `nix flake show`: Used for displaying information about a Nix flake's outputs.
    *   Example: `nix flake show github:NixOS/nixpkgs`
*   `find`: Used for searching for files in a directory hierarchy.
    *   Example: `find . -name "*.nix"`
*   `grep`: Used for searching text within files (often implicitly used by the agent's `search_file_content` tool).
    *   Example: `grep "some-pattern" some-file.txt`
